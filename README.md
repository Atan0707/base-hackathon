## What challenges I'm focusing on?

One of the key challenges we’re addressing in our community is the complexity of understanding and applying quadratic voting (QV) effectively. While QV is gaining attention, many still see it primarily in the context of funding public goods or token-based voting. We’re working to expand that perspective, showing how QV can be used not only for economic governance but also in broader contexts, such as IoT, decentralized infrastructure, and governance at scale.

Quadratic voting is about more than just money or funding; it’s a powerful tool for democratizing decision-making in real-world systems. For instance, we’re exploring its use to make smart cities more responsive to citizens' needs by allowing people to express varying intensities of preference on issues like energy management, environmental monitoring, and public services. This can fundamentally shift how we allocate resources in IoT-powered infrastructure, ensuring more equitable participation.

Additionally, in decentralized governance, where token-weighted voting often leads to centralization, QV provides a mechanism to empower minority voices without undermining broader consensus. It offers fairer decision-making in DAOs, supply chain management, and even decentralized content moderation, ensuring the community's interests are truly represented.

## How does it work

How long the LED will be turned on depends on the quadratic voting equation on chain.

## The fun of the project

Everything you see there is onchain! Even the time is calculated using blockchain data in real-time. HAHAHAH What a fun project tbh.
